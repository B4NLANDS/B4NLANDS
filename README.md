undiagnosed OSDD sys -- cannot get a diagnosis where i live

> Hi! We are the Ivy Thorn Collective, An undiagnosed OSDD System ! We are bodily fourteen with multiple adult alters, Though we do not allow flirting with any of our alters unless its our hosts partner. Respect our boundaries and we MAY get along, Though we do not accept friend requests unless we have talked alot.
>
> We currently have two cohost's, Azure and 1x1. They front often, Azure goes by he/it and 1x1 goes by it/they. 1x1 is a Dni Alter due to their behaviour when fronting alone, Liam is our systems host. He goes by masc pronouns mainly but is genderfluid.

> Our host is taken, And wishes to not be flirted with unless close / trusted or partner. And please call our alters by what they are called as most of us are from our sources, Except for two. Our host and a dormant alter. Please do not go out and harass us for being undiagnosed, As we cannot get a proper diagnosis where we live. 

> We are always on a BUSY/IDLE Status or a DNI/DNIUC/DNIUF Status, Due to some of our alters wishing not to be inted with.

> WHAT DOES DNI/DNIUF/DNIUC MEAN?: Do not interact, Do not interact unless close and do not interact unless friend! Just means someone does not want to be interacted with at all or specific people!
>
> Our host is HYPERSEXUAL, So we may say some out of pocket things. PLEAASE Communicate with us if we made you uncomfy otherwise we won't know.
>
> Our DNI is the criteria for DNI, But if you want to know our IWC/DNI then it is down below along with our IWC/DNI !
>
> We do not bite, Feel free to int w us aslong as we dont have DNI in my name ! We rarely ever accept friend requests unless we have talked for awhile.

> We are protective over our sources, As we are a mainly source attached system. You are still free to interact with us.
